I said to my soul, be still, and wait. 
Wait without hope - for hope would be hope for the wrong thing. 
Wait without love - for love would be love of the wrong thing.
There is yet faith - but the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting. 
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought.
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing. 


I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought;
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.
--T.S. Eliot, The Four Quartets

For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.
