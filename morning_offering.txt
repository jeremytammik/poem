A morning offering

I blessed the night that nourished my heart
To set the ghost of longing free
Into the flow and figure of dream
That went to harvest from the dark
Bread for the hunger no one sees.

All that is eternal in me
Welcomes the wonder of this day
The field of brightness it creates
Offering time for each thing
To enrise and illuminate

I place on the altar of dawn:
The quiet loyalty of breath
The tent of thought where I shelter
And all beauty drawn to the eye.

May my mind come alive today
To the invisible geography
That invites me to new frontiers
To break the dead shell of yesterdays
To risk being disturbed and changed.

May I have courage today
To live the life that I would love
To postpone my dreams no longer,
But do at last what I come here for
And waste my heart on fear no more.

John O'Donohue
