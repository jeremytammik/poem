Trust It, You'll Know

At this very instant,
is an aggressive flash
of heat,
followed by
flushed cheeks
and a mischievous grin,
you snicker with caution...
it feels so good inside. 

A careful glance-around
to see if you've been caught,
who’s watching, if you got-got.
Then an all-knowing
shake of the head,
authoritatively reminiscent of
“I told you so” and a 'hmm, hmm, hmm'.

Just when can you
be certain,
is the question,
you’re dying to
know the answer.
you find yourself craving
the security of certainty.

You’re on a mission
to slay the doubting dragon - the beast
of second-guessing,
consumed with fantastic notions,
pondering and daydreaming,
longing for the ecstasy of
just being
with the ‘right’ one.

Trust it,
You’ll just know.
