The Giveaway


Stand up.
Take off your shoes and plant your feet
   in the soil of the earth.
Don't cry out that you are afraid.
Become willing to feel the muck and mud
   you had rather avoid.
Open your mouth and speak,
   whatever truth you carry.
The world hungers for who you are,
   the way you gather the beauty of small things -
   a flower, a blade of grass, a sprig of sage -
   how you place them on the tree of your life.
Don't you see?
You are the giver. 
You are the gift.
